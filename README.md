# Movie-Rating-Predictions
Predict movie ratings with SVD
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to learn the relationship between two groups. 
Then the learned patterns can be used to predict interactions between a new member of either 
group and the other group members. Here we use SVD to learn the relationship between viewers 
movie ratings and the movies themselves. This allows us to predict how a view will feel about
a movie based on previous responses.
